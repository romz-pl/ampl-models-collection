# AMPL models collection


## [AMPL](https://ampl.com/) Overview

AMPL (A Mathematical Programming Language) is a high-level algebraic modeling language designed for describing and solving large-scale optimization problems. It was developed in the 1980s at Bell Laboratories by Robert Fourer, David Gay, and Brian Kernighan.

### What AMPL Does

AMPL allows you to express mathematical optimization problems in a natural, algebraic notation that closely resembles the mathematical formulation you'd write on paper. Instead of writing complex code to define optimization problems, you can express them in a way that looks very similar to the mathematical equations themselves.

### Key Features

AMPL separates the model (the mathematical structure of your problem) from the data (the specific numbers you're working with). This means you can define a general optimization problem once and then solve it with different datasets without rewriting the model.
The language supports various types of optimization problems including linear programming, nonlinear programming, integer programming, and mixed-integer programming. It can interface with numerous solvers like CPLEX, Gurobi, MINOS, and others, acting as a bridge between your problem description and the computational engine that solves it.

### Practical Use

AMPL is widely used in operations research, supply chain optimization, production planning, financial modeling, and engineering design. Its strength lies in making complex optimization accessible—you focus on describing what you want to optimize rather than how the computer should solve it. The language handles the translation of your model into a form that specialized solvers can work with efficiently.

MacMINLP page contains a collection of Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) test problems in AMPL.

## [COPS](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~more/cops/) Large-Scale Optimization Problems

The primary purpose of this collection is to provide difficult test cases for optimization software. Problems in the current version of the collection come from fluid dynamics, population dynamics, optimal design, mesh smoothing, and optimal control.
